Utopia Transfer is a simple and lite library to transfer and translate resources inbetween services. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project it is dependency free and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/transfer
```

Init in your application:
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

//TODO: Finish this
```

## System Requirements

Utopia Transfer requires PHP 8.0 or later. We recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.
